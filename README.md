# DMD Extensions

*Features for DMD owners that aren't officially supported*

Real DMDs for virtual pinball cabinets are pretty cool but they need to be
supported by the software running the games. This is an attempt to fill some
gaps.


## Supported Displays

Currently supported displays:

- **PinDMD v3**, full RGB support
- **PinDMD v2**, 4 bit (16 shades) support
- **PinDMD v1**, 2 bit (4 shades) support
- **PIN2DMD**, full RGB support

It's also possible to render to a virtual DMD on the computer screen if you 
want to test or debug or you don't have a real DMD.


## Features

The primary goal of this project was to add support real DMDs for games that
don't provide support out of the box. The first game was **Pinball FX2** and 
Farsight's **The Pinball Arcade** is supported as well.

The command line tool can also display image files on the DMD device and render
frames to bitmap files.


## Install Instructions

[Get the latest release](https://github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions/releases),
copy the content of the zip file to your hard drive, preferable in your `PATH`,
and unblock the `.exe` file (right-click, properties, unblock).

### Test

1. Open a command prompt ([Windows]+[R], `cmd`, [enter])
2. Type `dmdext test` [enter]

You should see a test image on your DMD as well as on a virtual DMD.

### Pinball FX2

1. Enable cabinet options in Pinball FX2
2. Resize the DMD to:
   - Width: `1040`
   - Height: `272`
3. Move the DMD to somewhere hidden like off-screen or behind the playfield
   (usually at `0`/`0`).
4. Open a command prompt ([Windows]+[R], `cmd`, [enter])
5. Type `dmdext mirror --source=pinballfx2 --no-virtual` [enter]
6. Start Pinball FX2

For further tweaking, see options below.

### The Pinball Arcade

For TPA we're pulling frames off the DMD texture from TPA's memory. Thus, you
must be running the tool as administrator.

1. Open an administrator command prompt ([Windows], type `cmd`, right-click on `cmd.exe`, click on "Run as administrator")
2. Type `dmdext mirror --source=pinballarcade --no-virtual` [enter]
3. Start the DX11 version of The Pinball Arcade.

Currently TPA's shades are re-mapped to custom values in order to achieve 
better contrast. If you think the shades come out wrong, feel free to open an
issue with comments.

Also note that currently only 128x32 DMD games are supported, that means no
EM games neither Frankenstein which has a different resolution.

## Compatibility

This application is based on .NET 4.5, which only runs on Windows 7 or later.
Probably on Vista too, but who cares. If you're still running WinXP then you
have my sincerest sympathy, but that's as far as I go. ;)
