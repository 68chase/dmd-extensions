# DMD Extensions

*Features for DMD owners that aren't officially supported*

Real DMDs for virtual pinball cabinets are pretty cool but they need to be
supported by the software running the games. This is an attempt to fill some
gaps.

## Supported Displays

Currently supported displays are the brand new **PinDMD v3**, as well as 
**PIN2DMD** and **PinDMD v2** (untested). 
For development there is also a virtual DMD that renders on the computer
screen, so you can fiddle with it without any display at all.

## Features

The primary goal of this project was to add support real DMDs for games that
don't provide support out of the box. The first game is Pinball FX2.


### Pinball FX2

Pinball FX2 supports basic cabinet features such as portrait mode and multi
monitors. These options must be enabled. The application will then grab pixels
off the DMD rendered by Pinball FX2, parse the dots and their luminosity and
send the data to the physical DMD.

The grabber should work even if the DMD is behind the playfield, so under
settings, move it to position `0`/`0`. Size should be the following:

- Width: `1040`
- Height: `272`

Then launch both the application, click on the *Pinball FX2* button and run 
Pinball FX2 (order doesn't matter). You should see frames appearing on your 
DMD.

## TODO

Since Pinball Arcade axed the promised cabinet features, we won't see any
official support soon (at all). Using the FreeCam mod, the same method as
for Pinball FX2 might be possible.

Nota that this is still considered proof of concept. A lot will change until 
the v1.0 tag. Report bugs either at VPF or [here on the bug tracker](https://github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions/issues).

## Compatibility

This application is based on .NET 4.5, which only runs on Windows 7 or later.
Probably on Vista too, but who cares. If you're still running WinXP then you
have my sincerest sympathy, but that's as far as I go. ;)
